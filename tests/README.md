# Testing Overview

Test suites live under this directory. Initial scope includes backend FastAPI tests; additional subpackages for frontend (Playwright), integration, and soak tests will be added following the testing strategy.

To run backend unit tests locally:
```bash
cd ../backend
uv run pytest
```
